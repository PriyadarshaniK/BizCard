To create a Streamlit application to upload a business card image, extract data from it, store it in MySQL and manipulate it.

This is a Streamlit application that allows users to
upload an image of a business card and extract relevant information from it using
easyOCR. The extracted information includes the company name, card holder
name, designation, mobile number, email address, website URL, area, city, state,
and pin code. The extracted information is then displayed in the application's
graphical user interface (GUI) rendered using Streamlit.
In addition, the application allows users to save the extracted information into
a database along with the uploaded business card image. The database has been created such that it is 
able to store multiple entries, each with its own business card image and extracted
information.
To achieve this, I have used Python, Streamlit, easyOCR, and a database
management system - MySQL. The application has a simple
and intuitive user interface that guides users through the process of uploading the
business card image and extracting its information. The extracted information is then displayed in a clean and organized manner, and users can easily
add it to the database with the click of a button. The user can Read the data,
Update the data and delete the data through the streamlit UI.
This project required skills in image processing, OCR, GUI development, and
database management.
